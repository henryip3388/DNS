# encrypted-dns-configs

## What

This is a fork of https://github.com/paulmillr/encrypted-dns

I attempted to get my changes upstreamed https://github.com/paulmillr/encrypted-dns/pull/113 but I have had no luck.

So this is the repo I use to apply a DoH resolver on iOS devices.

If I ever get a Mac I will sign the profiles and probably start my own repo.

## Install

Open either of these links on your iOS device.
